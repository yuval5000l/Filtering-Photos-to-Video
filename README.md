# Filtering-Photos-to-Video
Small Project I did with Neta. We wanted to find a photo filter and then do a video transition from the filter to the original image So why not do it ourselves? 


### Instructions
In the "if __name__ == '__main__':" section, just change the path to your file 
and in the name enter your file name:

Made this using Python 3.11 ,numpy and open-cv packages.
So if you don't have them, you should download and install them for it to work.
