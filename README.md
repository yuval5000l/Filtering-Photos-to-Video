# Filtering-Photos-to-Video
Small Project I did with Neta. We wanted to find a photo filter and then do a video transition from the filter to the original image So why not do it ourselves? 

For example, if we take that photo:
![car](https://github.com/yuval5000l/Filtering-Photos-to-Video/assets/63983348/e06f274a-0919-43cb-bd0f-9cd46bfe34a3)

We wanted to make a "pencil filter", like this one:
![pencil2_car](https://github.com/yuval5000l/Filtering-Photos-to-Video/assets/63983348/8ddad1bb-436d-4b72-887d-23c61f0e6403)

And then, make a video that does a transition that starts with the "pencil filter" to the original image: 
![car jpg](https://github.com/yuval5000l/Filtering-Photos-to-Video/assets/63983348/439a4066-4022-4997-bd6f-c08f69120a99)




### Instructions
In the "if __name__ == '__main__':" section, just change the path to your file 
and in the name enter your file name:
![img](https://github.com/yuval5000l/Filtering-Photos-to-Video/assets/63983348/af9827df-492e-4b2b-98ec-0431d2cf6b6c)

Made this using Python 3.11 ,numpy and open-cv packages.
So if you don't have them, you should download and install them for it to work.
